# Data-cleaning_
🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing in Python
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the fundamental steps of data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas and Scikit-learn. It is designed as a beginner-friendly guide to prepare raw datasets for machine learning workflows.

🔹 Features

Create and explore a messy dataset (with missing values, duplicates, inconsistent entries).

Perform data cleaning:

Handle missing values (mean/median filling).

Remove duplicate records.

Standardize inconsistent categorical values.

Perform data preprocessing:

Scale numerical features using StandardScaler.

Encode categorical features using OneHotEncoder.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
